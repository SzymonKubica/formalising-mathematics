rintro -> like intro but then can do cases on something in one step
ext -> prove something by extensionality (e.g. equality of functions)
use cases to close the goal when there are no cases.

try -> tries to apply a tactic in brackets repeatedly but succeeds regardless.

we can use let instead of specialize:
  let ha := ha ε hε,

^ experiment with that one

We can do library search in standalone lemmas and then apply the found functions
in our proofs.

use cases with

look at conv mode

In the project comment a lot in the lemmas and if something follows from them
then write it in a concise way.

-> use nth_rewrite to rewrite only one occurrence of a specific pattern.
