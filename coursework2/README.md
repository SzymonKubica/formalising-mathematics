Clarification regarding the content of the zip file.

When developing my proof I created a new lean project, therefore I include
the leanpgk.toml file in the zip. However, I didn't change any configuration
relative to the course repo and tested that the file with my proof also works
when pasted into the src/ directory of the (correctly initialised) course repo.

Nevertheless, I decided to include the .toml file as the github repo revision
number is different.

The zip file also contains the project2_report.pdf file containing the report.
