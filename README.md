# Formalising Mathematics

This repository contains formal proofs of three mathematical theorems using
the Lean programming language. The theorems are some of the most fundamental
statements in mathematical analysis:

- Intermediate Value Theorem
- Vitali's Theorem
- Banach-Steinhaus Theorem.

Many thanks to Professor Kevin Buzzard for teaching me how to write production-level
Lean code and guiding me along the way of building those three projects as a part
of the Formalising Mathematics course at Imperial College London in Spring 2023.

I also wanted to thank the [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib)
community for building the library allowing for proving undergraduate-level theorems
using Lean.
